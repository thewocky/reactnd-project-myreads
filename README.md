# MyReads Project

My submission for the MyReads project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

To run the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Problems/questions
- Entering a space in search reduces results to 0. i.e. 'linux' returns 20 results but 'linux ' returns nothing (known issue)

## To do (if this were a real app)
- Add animation when removing books
- Add paging to search results
- Give it some style


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
